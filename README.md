# Shallow CNN for Binary Classification of Tumor vs Non-Tumor images in Patch Camelyon 
Shallow CNN on Benchmark data Patch Camelyon

We will use the Camelyon dataset [1]. To facilitate research on these challenging data, a subset of images with fixed splits called PatchCamelyon (PCam) was released for benchmarking by Bastiaan S, Veeling and Jasper Linmans, Jim Winkens, Taco Cohen and Max Welling [2].

The data can be downloaded by executing the download_data.sh in the data/ folder.
Depending on your bandwidth, the download may take several minutes.
